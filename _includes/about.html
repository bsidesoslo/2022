        <p>BSides Oslo is a independent, community-driven inclusive information security conference. A part of the global Security BSides network, the conference creates a space for members of the information security community to come together and share their knowledge and experiences. BSides Oslo is intended for anyone working with, studying with or is interested in security.</p>

	<p>BSides Oslo 2022 will be the third, and the second physical event. <a href="{{ ticket_sale_url }}">Ticket sale has re-opened</a>.
