How could attackers gain control of hundreds of million devices? In this talk Vangelis explains how attackers can exploit a series of simple, yet critical API flaws that are typical “rush to market” flaws which allow an attacker to control and even use them as an initial foothold in millions of networks.

Devices vary from routers to alarms and car chargers. It seems that the era of “central platform” handling that solves a variety of problems (like port forwarding) backfired by re-introducing a number of vulnerabilities that were thought to be long gone.
