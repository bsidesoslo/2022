With the ever-increasing use of Bluetooth devices in the daily life of the average citizen, many will own at least one device, if not several, which can be used as tracking devices.

This technology is vulnerable to tracking/surveillance without the individual’s notice and online connection. This presentation will show that it is possible to do not only tracking of a single individual but mass tracking/surveillance of a large city as well, i.e Oslo.
