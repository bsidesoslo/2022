  bio: |
    Lorena Carthy-Wilmot works as a Digital Forensics Investigator at PwC in Oslo, Norway. She is currently researching for a master's degree in Cyber Security at the Teesside University in Middlesbrough, UK. She is interested in everything-forensics, cyber threat intelligence, learning new skills and cats and dogs, of course.

This is a presentation based on Lorena's research for her master's degree. Lorena has created an agile-focused framework that is based on only 4 steps for turning intelligence into action. This means that by applying the framework, deferenders can focus on identifying the threat to understand the outcomes.

Fast and easy; agile.
