    She is currently researching for a master's degree in Cyber Security at the Teesside University in Middlesbrough, UK within the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence, a new and growing interest of hers.

This is a presentation based on Lorena's research for her master's degree. Lorena has created an agile-focused framework that is based on only 4 steps for turning intelligence into action. This means that by applying the framework, deferenders can focus on identifying the threat to understand the outcomes.

Fast and easy; agile.
